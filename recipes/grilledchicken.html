    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 ounces)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. herbes de Provence or 3/4 teaspoon each dried basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, divided</li>
        <li>olive oil for brushing grill</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            For the brine: Stir the ice water, wine, salt, sugar,
            2 tablespoons herbes de Provence, 
            peppercorns and bay leaves in a nonreactive bowl 
            until the salt and sugar dissolve.
            Add chicken and refrigerate for 4 hours, no longer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Light grill using Kingsford® Charcoal with Sure Fire Grooves®.
            Spread the coals, banking them with a thick (hot) layer on 
            one side, and a thin (cooler) layer on the other.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from brine; pat dry with paper towels. 
            Brush breasts with oil. Mix 1 tablespoon herbes de Provence
            and ground pepper and rub onto breasts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly oil the grill. Place chicken over hot area of the grill; 
            cover the grill. Cook until the undersides are seared with 
            grill marks, about 2 minutes. Turn and sear the other sides, 
            about 2 minutes more. Move to the cooler side of the grill and 
            cover. Cook until the chicken springs back when pressed in the center, 
            about 10 minutes. Let stand for 3 minutes, then serve.
        </li>
        <li>*To brine the chicken for 4 to 8 hours, reduce the amount of salt and 
            sugar to 2 tablespoons each.
